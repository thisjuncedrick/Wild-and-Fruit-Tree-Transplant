Ever planted an expensive fruit tree just one tile in the wrong direction? Or maybe you want to redesign your farm layout without chopping down your beautiful, fully-grown wild trees?

**Wild and Fruit Tree Transplant** allows you to safely pick up and move both wild and fruit trees around your farm and beyond!

You can choose between two completely different ways to move your trees, depending on your preferred playstyle:

### 1. Robin's Carpenter Service (Immersive Mode)
By default, Robin offers a new "Transplant" service right from her shop menu!

* **How it works**: Talk to Robin, select "Transplant," and choose where you want to work (like your Farm or Ginger Island, if visited; otherwise default to Farm). You will be taken to a building menu, just like when you buy a barn or coop.
* **Cost**: Robin charges a small fee for her hard work. (Default: 50g for Wild Trees, 150g for Fruit Trees)

### 2. Free Transplant Mode (Do-It-Yourself)
Prefer to get your own hands dirty? You can turn off Robin's service in the settings to enable Free Mode.

* **How it works**: Walk up to any tree, hold down the **Transplant Hotkey** (Default: **B**), and press your **Tool Button** (_Left-Click_). The tree will be picked up, and you can walk around to find the perfect spot to place it down.
* **Cross-Location**: Unlike Robin's service, this mode let's you transplant anywhere apart from the standard location provided in Robin's Carpenter Service mode.
* **Cancel anytime**: Changed your mind? Just press **Escape** and the tree will safely pop right back to where you originally found it.

### Customization
This mod is fully compatible with the [Generic Mod Config Menu﻿](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098). You can easily tweak the rules from the main menu or in-game:

* **Service Toggle**: Switch between Robin's paid service or Free Mode.
* **Pricing**: Adjust how much Robin charges to move trees.
* **Tree Rules**: Decide exactly what kinds of trees can be moved! By default, you can only move healthy, fully-grown trees. However, you can toggle settings to allow moving: Young trees (saplings); Trees with Tappers currently attached; Stumps; Trees struck by lightning;
* **Force Transplant**: Bypass all tree checks, allowing you to transplant trees in any tile.

## Installation
1. Install the latest version SMAPI﻿.
2. (Optional but highly recommended) Install Generic Mod Config Menu to easily change your settings in game.
3. Download this mod and unzip it into your Stardew Valley/Mods folder.
4. Launch the game using SMAPI!

## Uninstallation
1. Delete the mod's folder folder from your Stardew Valley/Mods folder.

## Notice and Compatibility
* **SMAPI Warnings**: You might see a SMAPI warning like this:

    ```
    [SMAPI]    Patched game code
    [SMAPI]    --------------------------------------------------
    [SMAPI]       These mods directly change the game code. They're more likely to cause errors or bugs in-game; if
    [SMAPI]       your game has issues, try removing these first. Otherwise you can ignore this warning.

    [SMAPI]       - Wild and Fruit Tree Transplant
    ```

  This is normal as this mod uses Harmony to inject the "Transplant" option.

* **Missing "Transplant" Button?** If another mod also alters Robin's shop dialogue, the option might get hidden. You can either temporarily disable the conflicting mod, or just switch to "Free Mode" in the GMCM settings to move trees yourself.
